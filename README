The gengine 3D Graphical Engine
===============================

This program serves as my first steps in the field of computer graphics. It is
able to place various built-in objects in a scene, and load OBJ models in it.

You can move around in the 3D space with the W and S keys, look around with
the mouse, reset your position with the R key, or quit with the Q key.

There are two usable fragment shaders. One for Phong shading, and one for 
non-photorealistic (NPR) shading. 

If you are using Microsoft Visual Studio, you'll have to define M_PI
project-wide yourself, as the cmath header of Visual Studio does not have it
defined.
